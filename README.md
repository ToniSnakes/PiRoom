# PiRoom
  This project is a terminal-only chatroom inspired by MUDs, old-school chatrooms and the fact that I have a Raspberry Pi just lying around which I would like to use as a server of sorts.
  
#### The challenge
  In order to turn this project into a challenge and to enhance the learning process, one of the basic rules that I've set is that it should all be done in C and all functionality should be written by hand (within reason and the learning scope of the project).
